Description: C library for crystal symmetry determination (development files)
 Spglib is a C library for crystal symmetry determination. Symmetry
 operations, space groups and other data can be obtained using this
 symmetry finder.
 .
 Features include:
 .
  * Identify space-group type
  * Find symmetry operations
  * Find a primitive cell
  * Search irreducible k-points
  * Refine crystal structure
  * Wyckoff position assignment
 .
 This package contains static library and header files.
